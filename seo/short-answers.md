# Short Answer Questions – Workcity Assessment

## 1. Difference between Google Knowledge Graph and Google Knowledge Panel
The **Google Knowledge Graph** is Google’s internal database of entities (people, organizations, brands, places, etc.) and the relationships between them.  
The **Knowledge Panel** is the user-facing visual box that appears in search results when Google has enough confidence in an entity stored in the Knowledge Graph.  
Graph = database. Panel = display.

## 2. How Google determines entity identity
Google confirms an entity’s identity through:
- Consistent information across authoritative sources (LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Wikipedia, social media, directories).  
- Structured data (Organization, Person, Website schema).  
- A strong “entity home” page on the official website.  
- External citations and backlinks from trusted websites.  
- Matching brand signals such as sameAs profiles, logo consistency, descriptions, and founder info.

## 3. When to create Custom Post Types instead of pages
Use a **Custom Post Type** when the content is:
- Repeatable (e.g., Events, Services, Team Members, Properties, Courses).  
- Requires custom fields, taxonomies, or templates.  
- Needs its own archive page or structured database-like layout.  
Static pages should only be used for one-off content such as Home, About, Contact.

**LiteSpeed Cache** – Best all-in-one caching, image optimization, CDN support, critical CSS, and server-level page cache.  
**WP Super Cache** – Simple, reliable caching for WordPress sites that don’t need advanced optimization.  
**W3 Total Cache** – Highly configurable caching plugin with minification, object cache, and CDN integration.  
**Smush or Imagify** – For image compression, lazy loading, and reducing media weight.
